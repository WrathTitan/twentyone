# TwentyOne (21)

## Introduction
We all know ["42"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Answer_to_the_Ultimate_Question_of_Life,_the_Universe,_and_Everything_(42)) is the answer to the ultimate question in the universe. 42 is the dream solution we all want to achieve. Today we are halfway there. TwentyOne is the engine which takes data and creates models and answers questions to many different kinds of problems. 21 is a generic tool which can be used in multiple use cases.

## Why use 21?

Solution = AI Expertise + Data -> 42 + Data ~ 21 + Data

Focus of 21 is to get an effective model quickly and reliably and it doesn't try to get state of the art model (though we can get best in class results). It is meant for non-data scientists to build models for their use case. 

21 is designed to leverage transfer learning as much as possible. For many problems the data requirement for 21 is minimal. This saves a lot of time, effort and cost in data collection. Model training is also greatly reduced.

It can also be used in situations where data is private and can't be shared for training. We can use [Torpedo Blocks (TBs)]() to trigger 21 to start the ML training remotely. The trained model can be made available for inference using right set of TBs. This helps in using the intelligence and results derived from private data and maintaining the privacy at the same time.

Though 21 tries to be an auto ML engine, it can be used as an augmented ML engine which can help data scientist to quickly develop models. This can bring best of both worlds leading to "Real Intelligence = Artificial Intelligence + Human Intelligence"

### Advantages
- Greatly improves development time
- Needs less amount of data
- Cost for development is minimal
- Builds robust models
- Learns best practices and uses them for similar use cases
- Data Security and Privacy
- Works on most of the common use cases

### Drawbacks
- Needs a lot of compute
- Can't be used for new kind of problems or very complex problems
